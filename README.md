### **📝 Overview**  
This project bridges the communication gap between the hearing and speech-impaired community and the general population by recognizing sign language gestures. Leveraging LSTM networks, which excel in sequential data processing, the system processes video frames to classify gestures accurately.  

---

### **✨ Features**  
- 🖥️ **Real-time Gesture Recognition:** Detects gestures from video streams or pre-recorded clips.  
- ⚙️ **Preprocessing Pipelines:** Converts video into frame sequences and extracts key features.  
- 🔄 **Customizable:** Adapts easily to other sign languages with minimal effort.  
- 📊 **Performance Metrics:** Evaluate with accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.  
- 🌐 **Deployment Ready:** Includes Flask-based web app integration.
